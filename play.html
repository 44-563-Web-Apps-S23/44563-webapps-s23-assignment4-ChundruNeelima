               MARY.</h6><p> [_Evasively._] </p><p>The garden is so pretty.
             </p>
             <h6>
              OLLIVANT.</h6> <p>Hasn't changed much, eh?</p>
        
            <h6> MARY.</h6><p>It seems different; perhaps it's the night.</p>
            <h6>
              OLLIVANT. </h6><p> guess it isn't up to its usual standard. Haven't seen your
          mother there so often this spring.</p>

            EMILY.</h6><p> [_Quietly._]</p><p> This dry spell is not good for flowers.</p>
    
                <h6> OLLIVANT.</h6><p> It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
               thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
              hill. <p>[_Turning to_ EMILY _and patting her_.] </p>Is there any of that spray
              mixture left, Emily, dear?
